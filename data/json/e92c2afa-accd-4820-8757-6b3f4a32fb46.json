And though only 15, I was an\nexperienced and fairly successful hand.\nAnil was watching a wrestling match when I approached him. He\nwas about 25 \u2014 a tall, lean fellow \u2014 and he lo", "oked easy-going, kind\nand simple enough for my purpose. I hadn\u2019t had much luck of late and\nthought I might be able to get into the young man\u2019s confidence.\n\u201cYou look a bit of a wrestler yourself,\u201d I said. A little flattery helps\nin making friends.\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d he replied, which put me off for a moment because at\nthat time I was rather thin.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said modestly, \u201cI do wrestle a bit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cHari Singh,\u201d I lied. I took a new name every month. That kept me\nahead of the police and m", "y former employers.\nAfter this introduction, Anil talked about the well-oiled wrestlers\nwho were grunting, lifting and throwing each other about. I didn\u2019t\nhave much to say. Anil walked away. I followed casually.\n\u201cHello again,\u201d he said.\nI gave him my most appealing smile. \u201cI want to work for you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t pay you.\u201d\nReprint 2025-26\nI thought that over for a minute.

But the meal I cooked that night must\nhave been terrible because Anil gave it to a stray dog and told me to be\noff. But I just hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he\ncouldn\u2019t help laughing.\nLater, he patted me on the head and said never mind, he\u2019d teach\nme to cook. He also taught me to write my name and said he would\nsoon teach me to write whole sentences and to", " add numbers. I was\ngrateful. I knew that once I could write like an educated man there\nwould be no limit to what I could achieve.\nIt was quite pleasant working for Anil. I made the tea in the morning\nand then would take my time buying the day\u2019s supplies, usually making\na profit of about a rupee a day. I think he knew I made a little money\nthis way but he did not seem to mind.\nThe Thief\u2019s Story\n9\nReprint 2025-26\nFootprints without Feet\n10\nAnil made money by fits and starts. He would borrow one w", "eek, lend\nthe next. He kept worrying about his next cheque, but as soon as it\narrived he would go out and celebrate. It seems he wrote for magazines \u2014\na queer way to make a living!\nOne evening he came home with a small bundle of notes, saying he\nhad just sold a book to a publisher. At night, I saw him tuck the money\nunder the mattress.\nI had been working for Anil for almost a month and, apart from\ncheating on the shopping, had not done anything in my line of work. I\nhad every opportunity for doi", "ng so. Anil had given me a key to the door,\nand I could come and go as I pleased. He was the most trusting person\nI had ever met.\nAnd that is why it was so difficult to rob him.

A beam of moonlight stepped over the balcony and\nfell on the bed. I sat up on the floor, considering the situation. If I took\nthe money, I could catch the 10.30 Express to Lucknow. Slipping out of\nthe blanket, I crept ", "up to the bed. Anil was sleeping peacefully. His\nface was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though\nmine were mostly scars.\nMy hand slid under the mattress, searching for the notes. When I\nfound them, I drew them out without a sound. Anil sighed in his sleep\nand turned on his side, towards me. I was startled and quickly crawled\nout of the room.\nWhen I was on the road, I began to run. I had the notes at my waist,\nheld there by the string of my pyjamas.

The train had still to pick\nup speed and I should have been able to jump into one of the carriages,\nbut I hesitated \u2014 for some reason I can\u2019t explain \u2014 and I lost the\nchance to get aw", "ay.\nWhen the train had gone, I found myself standing alone on the\ndeserted platform. I had no idea where to spend the night. I had no\nfriends, believing that friends were more trouble than help. And I did\nnot want to make anyone curious by staying at one of the small hotels\nnear the station. The only person I knew really well was the man I had\nrobbed. Leaving the station, I walked slowly through the bazaar.\nIn my short career as a thief, I had made a study of men\u2019s faces\nwhen they had lost their", " goods. The greedy man showed fear; the rich\nman showed anger; the poor man showed acceptance. But I knew that\nAnil\u2019s face, when he discovered the theft, would show only a touch of\nsadness. Not for the loss of money, but for the loss of trust.\nI found myself in the maidan and sat down on a bench. The night\nwas chilly \u2014 it was early November \u2014 and a light drizzle added to my\ndiscomfort. Soon it was raining quite heavily. My shirt and pyjamas\nstuck to my skin, and a cold wind blew the rain across ", "my face.\nReprint 2025-26\nFootprints without Feet\n12\nI went back to the bazaar and sat down in the shelter of the clock\ntower. The clock showed midnight. I felt for the notes. They were damp\nfrom the rain.\nAnil\u2019s money. In the morning he would probably have given me two or\nthree rupees to go to the cinema, but now I had it all. I couldn\u2019t cook his\nmeals, run to the bazaar or learn to write whole sentences any more.\nI had forgotten about them in the excitement of the theft. Whole\nsentences, I knew", ", could one day bring me more than a few hundred\nrupees. It was a simple matter to steal \u2014 and sometimes just as simple\nto be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and respected man,\nwas something else. I  should go back to Anil, I told myself, if only to\nlearn to read and write.\nI hurried back to the room feeling very nervous, for it is much\neasier to steal something than to return it undetected. I opened the\ndoor quietly, then stood in the doorway, in clouded moonlight. Anil\nwas still a", "sleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up\nwith the notes. I felt his breath on my hand. I remained still for a\nminute. Then my hand found the edge of the mattress, and slipped\nunder it with the notes.\nI awoke late next morning to find that Anil had already made the\ntea. He stretched out his hand towards me. There was a fifty-rupee\nnote between his fingers. My heart sank. I thought I had been discovered.\n\u201cI made some money yesterday,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow you\u2019ll be paid\nregularly.\u201d", "\nMy spirits rose.
